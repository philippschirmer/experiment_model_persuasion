# An Experiment on Model Persuasion | Final project for Effective Programming Practices for Economists
by
Carolina Alvarez and
Philipp Schirmer

## Abstract 

> We develop and implement a novel experimental design to test a theory of model-based
persuasion using the experimental platform oTree. To achieve this, we make use Python
and JavaScript code and employ HTML and CSS for the experiment’s visuals. In a game
between a sender and possibly multiple receivers, the sender can access an interactive
toolbox of different model choices that can be used to persuade a receiver. The model
messages contain no new ‘hard’ information, and should hence not move the beliefs of a
fully Bayesian receiver. In a setting that mimics real-life financial chart analysis, we can
test several hypotheses concerned with ‘sense-making’ persuasion by a potentially biased
sender.
