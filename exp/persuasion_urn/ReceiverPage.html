    <p>
        You are the {{ player.role }}. In this role, you will be playing a financial customer who can either buy 
        or sell stocks. You will be presented with different financial charts that show the development of 
        stock prices for a given time period.  
    </p>

    <p>
        You will have to make your decision by trying your best at predicting the stock price
        in the future. If you predict that the stock price is going to increase, then your best strategy is to 
        buy the stock at the current price and then sell the stock in the future to gain profit. On the other
        hand, if you predict the stock price is going to fall in the future, then the best option is to sell the 
        stock now and buy it later to gain aditional revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the second part of the game, you will be presented with financial graphs like in the first part. This time, the
        financial charts also include a model provided to you by a financial advisor. You will be again asked to decide on buying or selling the stock.

        In the next step, you will be answering some general comprehension questions, to check whether you fully understand
        your role in the game.
