************

For the final project in *Effective Programming Practices for Economists*, we implement a novel experimental
design that aims to provide a better understanding of persuasive communication between agents in a financial 
analysis setting. We use **oTree**, an open-source Python framework for experimental research, to develop a

The purpose of the documentation is to provide a clear understanding of the structure of the project and the
