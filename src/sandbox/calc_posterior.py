def calc_posterior():
    '''
    Calculate the model posterior distribution, taking as inputs the model space with prior,
    as well as the likelihood calculated from some observed data. Updates model prior using
    Bayes' formula.

    Inputs: model_space: 1D np.array
            model_prior  1D np.array, distribution over the model space with standard properties
            likelihoods: 1D np.array, likelihoods of the data
