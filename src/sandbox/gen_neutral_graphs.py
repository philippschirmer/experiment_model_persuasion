    '''TODO: Function that generates "neutral" graphs, i.e. graphs that don't have any model message yet
    To be used in the first part of the experiment, where the receiver decides without observing data.
    
    Inputs:
        data: 2D np.array of shape 2xT - Y's and X's to be plotted
        hyperparams: (optional?) 1D np.array - specifying special settings for the graph generation
        (TBD)

    Outputs: neutral_graph_`data': picture file with neutral graphs saved to prespecified
    project folder.
