        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        Each of you will represent a firm. Both firms manufacture the same product.
    </p>

    <p>
        The two of you decide simultaneously and independently how many units to manufacture.
        Your choices can be any number from 0 to {{ C.MAX_UNITS_PER_PLAYER }}.
        All produced units will be sold, but the more is produced, the lower the unit selling price will be.
    </p>


    <p>
        The unit selling price is:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <strong>Unit selling price = {{ C.TOTAL_CAPACITY }} – Units produced by your firm – Units produced by the other firm</strong>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Your profit is therefore:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <strong>Your profit = Unit selling price × Units produced by your firm</strong>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For your convenience, these instructions will remain available to you on all subsequent screens of this study.
