        Instructions
    </h3>
    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        Each of you will represent a firm. Each firm manufactures one unit of
        the same product at no cost.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each of you privately sets your price, anything from 0 to {{ C.MAXIMUM_PRICE }}.
        The buyer in the market will always buy one unit of the product at the
        lower price. In case of a tie, the buyer will buy from one of you at
        random. Your profit is your price if your product is sold and zero
        otherwise.
