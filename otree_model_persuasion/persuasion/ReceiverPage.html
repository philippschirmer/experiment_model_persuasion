    <p>
        You are the {{ player.role }}. In this role, you will be playing a financial client who can either buy 
        or sell stocks. You will be presented with different financial charts that show the development of 
        stock prices for a given time period.  
    </p>

    <p>
        You will have to make your decision by trying your best at predicting the stock price
        in the future. If you predict that the stock price is going to increase, then the best strategy is to 
        buy the stock at the current price and then sell the stock in the future to gain profit. On the other
        hand, if you predict the stock price is going to fall in the future, then the best option is to sell the 
        stock now and buy it later to gain aditional revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a later step of the game however, you will be presented with some models provided by financial 
        advisers - this is, you won't have to predict the price by yourself but rather choose the model 
        that you think fits the data better.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the next step, you will be answering some general comprehension questions, to check whether you fully understand
        your role in the game.
